        <p>Soon after resuming power, President Donald Trump's administration made many controversial and crucial decisions from abolishing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/birthright-citizenship-explained-trump-executive-order">birthright citizenship</a> to mandating <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/g-s1-46893/trump-anti-trans-rights-executive-action-gender-ideology-confusion">two genders</a> as the President signed a record <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025">26 executive orders</a> on his first day in office.</p>

        <p>One of the most far-reaching and disruptive changes came in the form of budget cuts, notably to the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/">U.S Agency for International Aid (USAID)</a> which has faced significant reductions in funding as the administration announced it has terminated more than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16">90%</a> of USAID's foreign assistance awards. The humanitarian aid agency has been a target of a government reorganization program led by Elon Musk, who is a close ally of Trump and heads the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DODGE).</p>

        <p>In the first week of February, the Trump administration announced plans to keep fewer than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-keeping-only-294-usaid-staff-out-over-10000-globally-2025-02-06/">300 staff</a> in the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) from the agency's worldwide total of more than 10,000 employees.</p>

        <p>It all started when in January, Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/marco-rubio-orders-halt-almost-us-foreign-aid-rcna189230">suspended U.S. foreign aid for 90 days</a> to review programs, following an executive order by the President, causing widespread disruptions. By March, the administration completed its review, resulting in the termination of almost all <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5310673/usaid-trump-administration-global-health">USAID programs.</a></p>

        <p>While more than 20 agencies help deliver US foreign aid, USAID is the main provider. The agency oversaw 61% of the more than $71 billion aid allocated in 2023, as reported by <a href="https://www.foreignassistance.gov/">ForeignAssistance.gov.</a></p>

        <p>An analysis of USAID's worldwide funding shows that the agency's priorities changed over the decade as Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. From there on till now, as per the reported figures, the agency has allotted more than $30 billion to Ukraine. This is a more than 96% increase in aid to the country. No other country has seen such a drastic increase in its aid, especially countries undergoing conflict, war or political shifts. In fact, aid to Afghanistan dropped in 2021 as U.S forces withdrew and Taliban took over the country.</p>

        <p>Most of the aid to Ukraine was provided in the "governance" category. From 2022-2024 $28 billion dollars were funded to the country for "governance", a category that includes support for institution building, good governance and macroeconomic stability in conflict zones. This shift has also changed how the agency allocates its funding. Earlier health was the largest funded category.</p>

        <p>Dismantling USAID would not only disrupt vital support for Ukraine but also jeopardize life-saving aid worldwide. USAID funds essential programs that provide emergency relief, health services, food security, and education in countries affected by conflict and poverty. These include initiatives such as combating the spread of infectious diseases, supporting refugee populations, and promoting sustainable development.</p>

        <p>The reduction in U.S. foreign assistance threatens these critical humanitarian programs, leaving millions without essential support and deepening global crises, ultimately undermining efforts to alleviate suffering in some of the world's most vulnerable regions.</p>
