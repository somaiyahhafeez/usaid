# USAID Foreign Assistance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the distribution of foreign assistance provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) across different countries, looking at ten year's of data. The analysis utilizes data sourced from [ForeignAssistance.gov](https://www.foreignassistance.gov/).
With USAID facing aid cuts and employee lay offs, my aim was to look at how the agency has provided aid worldwide, particularly which countries have recieved highest aid.
## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Top 10 Countries Receiving USAID**: 
   - The analysis highlights which countries have consistently been the largest recipients of USAID over the years, shedding light on U.S. foreign aid priorities.
  
- **Ukraine’s Aid Trends**: 
   - I looked at the aid to Ukraine as it saw a huge surge in aid after Russian invasion. 


## 💾 Data Collection Process

The raw data was sourced from [ForeignAssistance.gov](https://www.foreignassistance.gov/), which provides detailed records of U.S. foreign assistance. CSV files (e.g., `results.csv`, `results(1).csv`) were downloaded and processed for this analysis.

The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Python, specifically using Pandas.

## 🧑‍💻 Data Analysis Process

The analysis is detailed in the `USAID.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Here’s a summary of the steps taken:

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**: 
   - The raw CSV data was imported and concatenated.
  
2. **Top 10 Countries Analysis**: 
   - The countries receiving the highest amounts of aid were identified.
  
3. **Ukraine Aid Trend Analysis**: 
   - A specific focus on Ukraine’s yearly aid.
  
4. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Using Datawrapper.

## 🧠 Skills & Approaches

In this project, I utilized the following skills:

- **Data Manipulation**: 
   - Cleaned and prepared large datasets using the `pandas` library for analysis.
  
- **Data Visualization**: 
   - Created meaningful visualizations.
  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: 
   - For countries facing war, conflict.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in handling large datasets.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Here are some aspects I wanted to explore further, but due to time constraints, were not included in this analysis:
  
- **Specific Program Analysis**: 
   - Investigating which specific programs or projects were funded by USAID, and how those projects have evolved.
