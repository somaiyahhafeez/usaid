The activity will provide specialized technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture as it implements reforms in the spheres of land administration, irrigation, organic production development, market access for farmers, and rural development. In order to implement international approaches and best practices into the system of state control over food business operators and ensure harmonization with European directives and regulations on food quality and safety, ARDS experts will advise and help implement the the transfer of regulatory responsibilities from government to business associations and CSOs, and conduct trainings and mentorships to improve their capacity to perform the functions of self-regulatory organizations with a focus on the dairy and meat value chains. To improve productivity and agricultural sector competitiveness, ARDS will connect small and medium farmers in fruit, vegetables, meat, and dairy value chains to businesses higher up  in the value chain, that buy produce for processing from surrounding small farmers in their communities. As a result of these partnerships, small farmers will increase their incomes by selling more of their produce to processors. These rural households will also be able to plan and invest in their production because they will know that they have a steady and growing market through processors. ARDS will use grants to co-finance such projects together with processors. In addition, an important element of ARDS assistance is introduction of international quality and safety standards across the targeted value chains in order to increase market access for producers.- Ukraine Emergency Assistance to Civilians Affected by ConflictThis project provides training for up to 350 participants over five years in the United States and third countries.

To improve productivity and agricultural sector competitiveness, ARDS will connect small and medium farmers in fruit, vegetables, meat, and dairy value chains to businesses higher up  in the value chain, that buy produce for processing from surrounding small farmers in their communities. As a result of these partnerships, small farmers will increase their incomes by selling more of their produce to processors. These rural households will also be able to plan and invest in their production because they will know that they have a steady and growing market through processors. ARDS will use grants to co-finance such projects together with processors. In addition, an important element of ARDS assistance is introduction of international quality and safety standards across the targeted value chains in order to increase market access for producers.Decentralization Offering Better Resultsand Efficiency (Dobre)In light of the foregoing challenges and opportunities for justice sector reform, the Nove Pravosuddya Program will engage multiple stakeholders to support the Goal of independent, accountable, transparent and effective justice system that upholds the rule of law and is empowered to fight corruption.

Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits TO (GHSC- RTKs) serves as the singular means of procuring HIV RTKs within the GHSC Program. The GHSC was designed to provide supply chain technical assistance as well as commodity procurement for the Bureau of Global Health, regardless of the commodity type. As the primary diagnostic tool for determining HIV/AIDS status and the gateway for care and treatment of HIV positive people, RTKs play a vital role in combatting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Without an adequate and timely supply of quality RTKs, HIV/AIDS programs cannot function. Thus Remote Medical International (RMI) will play a vital role in supporting the USGs goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in our lifetime. The primary objective of this Contract is to ensure the availability of approved HIV Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) using a global procurement strategy. An RTK is defined as an assay for the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1/2 or type specific diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2, from which test results can be read directly, within 30 minutes of the time the specimen is applied to the device, without calibration or calculations. The USAID Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits (GHSC- RTKs) project will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of HIV rapid test kits (RTKs) to designated destinations and stakeholders for use in host country HIV and AIDS programs. Other procurement and supply chain-related services will be provided by other contracts within the GHSC Program. This TO is a small business set aside.Administrative costs and operating expenses of USAID contributing to Travel and Transportation.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.Emergency humanitarian assistanceThe provision of effective protection, assistance, and durable solutions for refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and other victims of conflict and disasters.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.Humanitarian response depot networkThis program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.Procurement of 41,220 kitchen setsHumanitarian assistance funding.Funding for food assistanceFood assitance, WASH and protection activitiesWill provide support to countries in political transition with rapid and effective technical assistance for positive political change.

the singular means of procuring HIV RTKs within the GHSC Program. The GHSC was designed to provide supply chain technical assistance as well as commodity procurement for the Bureau of Global Health, regardless of the commodity type. As the primary diagnostic tool for determining HIV/AIDS status and the gateway for care and treatment of HIV positive people, RTKs play a vital role in combatting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Without an adequate and timely supply of quality RTKs, HIV/AIDS programs cannot function. Thus Remote Medical International (RMI) will play a vital role in supporting the USGs goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in our lifetime. The primary objective of this Contract is to ensure the availability of approved HIV Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) using a global procurement strategy. An RTK is defined as an assay for the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1/2 or type specific diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2, from which test results can be read directly, within 30 minutes of the time the specimen is applied to the device, without calibration or calculations. The USAID Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits (GHSC- RTKs) project will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of HIV rapid test kits (RTKs) to designated destinations and stakeholders for use in host country HIV and AIDS programs. Other procurement and supply chain-related services will be provided by other contracts within the GHSC Program.

Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits TO (GHSC- RTKs) serves as the singular means of procuring HIV RTKs within the GHSC Program. The GHSC was designed to provide supply chain technical assistance as well as commodity procurement for the Bureau of Global Health, regardless of the commodity type. As the primary diagnostic tool for determining HIV/AIDS status and the gateway for care and treatment of HIV positive people, RTKs play a vital role in combatting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Without an adequate and timely supply of quality RTKs, HIV/AIDS programs cannot function. Thus Remote Medical International (RMI) will play a vital role in supporting the USGs goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in our lifetime. The primary objective of this Contract is to ensure the availability of approved HIV Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) using a global procurement strategy. An RTK is defined as an assay for the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1/2 or type specific diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2, from which test results can be read directly, within 30 minutes of the time the specimen is applied to the device, without calibration or calculations. The USAID Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits (GHSC- RTKs) project will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of HIV rapid test kits (RTKs) to designated destinations and stakeholders for use in host country HIV and AIDS programs. Other procurement and supply chain-related services will be provided by other contracts within the GHSC Program. This TO is a small business set aside.This program supports the Mission's goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following
